       <img src="../images/into_the_woods.jpg" style="width:239px;height:354px; margin:0 40px 30px 0;"> 
       <p style="color:#779E96; font-size:200%; text-align:center; padding: 0 0 25px 0;">Into the Woods</p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">It has been a long time since "Into The Woods" first aired, but it wasn't until a few days ago that I managed to see it. I can now firmly state that this is one of the few remakes of a classical story worth watching. </p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">The script mixes different stories such as "Rapunzel", "Little Red Ridding Hood", "Jack and The Beanstalk", "Cinderella", keeping the main idea from each of them, but adding several more. And so, the whole movie revolves around the quotation "Be careful what you wish for". When all the stories reach their happily ever after, the plot takes an unusual turn as a giant willing to kill them all shows up. As the events unfold, they all loose someone they love and learn an important lesson. 
         </p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">The three times Oscar Winner Meryl Streep gives a lovely performance as the witch, the character that actually links the stories between them. Her song is one of the most important scenes for the psychological side of the film, song that talks about people's tendency of putting the blame on someone else, even if they carry a part of it themselves. During this moment, she accepts that she had made a mistake and the consequence of her action. By taking on the curse her mother made upon her (despite the fact that she had been trying for ages to get rid of it and finally succeeded), she makes everyone realize that, sometimes, what we want might not be what we need. Following the witch's example, they all stop fighting or accusing each other and work together to defeat the female giant.
         </p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">Either you enjoy movies of this sort or not, you should definitely watch it as it is one of the best regarding the genre!
