       <p>After a year of waiting, "Hunger Games:Mockingjay" is finally here to keep us on the edge of our seats. </p>
       <p>The one aspect that impressed me in a particular way was the plot. It was marvelously written and, unlike the novel, kept me gripped all the way through. On the whole, the book is brilliant, with an unusual and gorgeous idea. Still, the first part of it was quite boring. The action is set only in District 23, describing Katniss' depression and Plutarch's struggle to unite the country in the fight against the Capitol. The film goes further and actually shows people's riot. For example, in District 5, citizens blow up the barrage in order to leave Panem without power. The sequence is stunning, showing a group of rebels walking towards the building with their bare hands, facing up to armed soldiers. The soundtrack is really motivating, both the lyrics and the violin chords inspire hope for a better future. At this point, I realized that music had a serious part on the overall impression. If it hadn't been for it, some shots would have been dull and with no impact on the viewer. 
         </p>
       <p>As far as the characters are concerned, I believe that some of the actors didn't put their heart and soul into this piece of art. At the beginning, Mrs. Everdeen(cast by Jennifer Lawrence) wasn't true to life as her reactions seemed exaggerated. But, while the events unfold, she manages to get on the right track. On the other hand, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) surprised me in a pleasant way as he was more natural in front of the cameras than he used to be! Donald Sutherland kept his high standards of acting, playing a dangerous, atrocious president. He performed in such an amazing way that, when you looked at his face, the words "evil" and "snake" were the first ones that crossed anyone's mind. The way he pronounces the lines also makes the viewer come to these conclusions.
         </p>
       <p>All in all, I strongly believe that it is a screening worth not missing. After you finish it, you will most probably be so excited that you won't be able to think or talk about anything else for an hour or two!
