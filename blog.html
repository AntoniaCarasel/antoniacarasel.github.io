    <p style="margin:100px 0 0 0;">The feeling she got while listening to the song was beyond description. It was as if she was living in a different world, one that was long gone, but its red, old beauty was still there, startling her. As she was watching the image of Tara on screen, tears were streaming down her face with a completeness that only she was capable of, for she was no longer a spectator, but rather a part of that story of the Old South that was falling and of a strong love that was so dear to her ripened soul. 
    </p>
    <p>This was how deeply and fully things were affecting her, it was almost as if all the passion the world was lacking was gathered into her soul and mind. She felt as a stranger for a moment, but then she threw that thought away as she could not be any different and she was not willing make a change! Quaint as she might seem, she was one of a kind with a heart that was capable of so much understanding, capable to take so much love and love deeper than anyone could imagine. As hard as it was to perceive such a thing, her love was unique, with an eagerness and plenitude hard to find. And as a poor child, she wasâ€¦she was seeking for the same love to come back to her. For she was a torrent of emotions, she was expecting a storm equally strong or even stronger to fulfill hers, to match hers. And combined they would either forget or destroy the whole world. This is why she felt so free and peaceful when it was heavily raining outside. She wanted to feel the rain drowning the world, the wind blowing and taking away everything, to feel like in the middle of a hurricane that was sweeping away the whole damned world.
    </p>
    <p>But people were not like that and she was by far too smart not to understand that she was one in a million. So she accepted that and decided that this world of hers could only find its place in her imagination and in the depths of her soul. She whipped her tears and on the chords of "Dixie" she put on a smile that symbolized her acceptance and the power to release the anchor back to earth and keep it that way. The strangest thing about her was the ability of being both so dreamy and living in her own little place, far away in books and movies, and of being so down to earth, capable to choose for herself, to do almost anything if she truly wanted that thing to happen to her. There was no place for excuses, no room for people that said "It is far beyond your possibilities". She could have the world if she wanted it to be hers.
