    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
     <div style="margin:50px 150px 50px 150px;"> 
       <img src="../images/mamma_mia.jpg" style="width:239px;height:354px; margin:0 40px 30px 0;"> 
       <p style="color:#64CDFA; font-size:200%; text-align:center; padding: 0 0 15px 0;">Mamma mia!</p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">When we say “Mamma Mia” we inevitably think of two major productions, one still dominating the music history and another which is a box office in the world of drama.        But who would have imagined that it is not just a simple name coincidence? </p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">Everyone has heard at least once of the popular band of the 70’s ABBA, am I  right? Twenty-six years after their split, a musical named after one of their best-known songs aired on the big screen. Furthermore, the soundtrack was entirely made up of the band’s hits, an idea that I actually find quite intriguing. It requires an inventive mind in order to be able to write a plot that would perfectly match both the script and the famous tracks. They were all well chosen and placed with extreme caution inside the script. The way I see it, this is the glue that holds the pieces together in this movie, the thing that makes it different and beautiful to watch.
         </p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">The plot does not thrill the viewer in any particular way, but it is not dull either. A young girl willing to get married decides to send out a letter to her father to invite him at the blessed event. The only problem is that she has never met him…or them. After having read her mother’s diary, she comes to the conclusion that she may be the daughter of either of three men. So, the twenty-year old girl invites them all, hoping she will discover her biological parent and that he will give her away. However, despite the fact that the plot in general was well-written, there were some scenes extremely exaggerated due to the actors’ body movement. For instance, I can recall one in which Donna was rolling on the pavement or another with Sophie crawling towards her fiancée, parts that emphasize really well this idea. 
         </p>
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">The acting is absolutely brilliant in most of the cases as the screening brings together well-known actors as Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters. Still, given the fact that it is a musical I believe that the casting was not strict enough when it comes to their voices. If I were to judge, I’d say this is the biggest flaw of the movie, the reason why you can’t name it a masterpiece. For example, some songs interpreted by Pierce Brosnan sounded just right, but others were completely out of rhythm. Set aside with the clean voice of Meryl Streep, it makes an unpleasant combination, the most representative passage being the one with the duet of the song “S.O.S.”. Hopefully, the moment with the track “The Winner Takes It All” comes along, with a marvelous performance and a fascinating picture of the island, captured from different angles, while following Donna’s running to the Church on top. 
         </p> 
       <p style="text-indent:50px;">For better for worse, the movie makes a nice Saturday distraction from the daily routine of our lives.
